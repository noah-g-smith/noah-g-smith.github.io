            <p>
              In 2019 I received a Bachelor of Science from Monash University with a major 
              in astrophysics and minor in mathematics. Astrophysics at Monash provided an 
              introduction to scientific programming in the form of developing astrophysical 
              (computational) models and working with large data sets. The mathematics provided 
              a solid foundation for this work, the confidence to tackle challenging new 
              problems, and the impetus to do it with rigour. 
            </p>

              Since graduation I have set my focus on developing the skillset for a career in
               data science: leaning the relevant foundational concepts, solving real-world
                problems, programming daily, and, more recently, building a portfolio to 
                demonstrate my competencies. If there is an underlying motivation for my work, 
                it is a passion for problem solving, logic, and mathematics. I am drawn to frame 
                problem spaces in mathematical terms - 'What mathematics describes this situation, 
                this problem, and potential solutions'. And data science is a field where I can 
                put this passion to work..
