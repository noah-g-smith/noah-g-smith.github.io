          <p>
            In 2019 I received a Bachelor of Science from Monash University with a major 
            in astrophysics and minor in mathematics. Astrophysics at Monash provided an 
            introduction to scientific programming in the form of developing astrophysical 
            (computational) models and working with large data sets. The mathematics provided 
            a solid foundation for this work, the confidence to tackle challenging new 
            problems, and the impetus to do it with rigour. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Since graduation I have set my focus on developing the skillset for a career in
            data science: leaning the relevant foundational concepts, solving real-world
            problems, programming daily, and, more recently, building a portfolio to 
            demonstrate my competencies. If there is an underlying motivation for my work, 
            it is a passion for problem solving, logic, and mathematics. I am drawn to frame 
            problem spaces in mathematical terms - 'What mathematics describes this situation, 
            this problem, and potential solutions'. And data science is a field where I can 
            put this passion to work..
