            <p>
              Noah graduated from Monash University in 2019 with a Bachelor of Science 
              majoring in astrophysics and minoring in mathematics. Astrophysics at Monash 
              provided an introduction to scientific programming which took the form of 
              programming astrophysical models and working with large data sets. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Since then Noah has set his focus on programming daily, learning data science 
              relevant concepts, and creating data science projects. In contrast to others
              entering the field as an IT graduate, a heavy background in mathematics has 
              provided extremely useful. For many tackling computer science problems, the
              underlying mathematics is the crux of the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              An almost obsessive interest in problem solving and mathematics has kept Noah
              continuously learning on his own time. Whenever a real world situation poses
              a problem he is drawn to think, “What mathematics describes this situation and
              can I solve it?”
