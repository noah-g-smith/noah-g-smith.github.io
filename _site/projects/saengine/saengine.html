        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>In the final year of my Masterâ€™s degree, I developed a sentiment analysis engine as part of my academic
        professional practice. The engine forms the backend of a sentiment analysis web application which was
        initially developed by students at Deakin University for an external (industry) client.<p>

        <p>The engine (and associated IP) has since been acquired by a startup and will become the core of
        a commercial service. The code and specific engineering is now proprietary IP and cannot be
        discussed here. Instead I can provide a basic overview of the problem space and solution.</p>

        <h3>Problem-Space</h3>
        <p>Data-based decison-making has traditionally been based on tightly controlled data gathering and highly-structured
        data (think a clinical trial). At the same time, communication technologies have provided for the wholesale collection of
        vast amounts of largely unstructured feedback (think commentary), solicted and unsolicited.</p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>A web-based sentiment analysis service/platform that first targets the evaluation industry - those that are already
        in the business of providing/implementing sentiment analysis. At the core of this solution is a 'sentiment analysis engine' that
        takes unstructured feedback data and proprietary domain dicionaries to produce domain-based and overall sentiment analysis scores.</p>

        <p>While my role was to lead the back-end development team, I also had the opportunity to undertake some business analysis - specifically
        looking at rapid development and implementation of a flexible and scalable solution using a small team of developers, delivering
        a prototype solution on AWS (Amazon Web Services).</p>

        <h3>Architecture</h3>

        <h3>Output & Analytics</h3>

        <p>Engine output is available to clients for integration into their own systems (via manual download or API). The service also
            provides for extensive online analytics, allowing evaluation teams to draw insight immediately without futher
            local computation, and also serves as a filtration mechanism; human review being necessary in order to obtain
            precise/nuanced understanding of written work.</p>

       <p>The service provides extensive custom pre-processsing and post-processing. At its most basic, users will be able to
           filter comments of particular interest and insight, ignoring data of insignificant value. Below is a very small
           representative output from university unit feedback with accompanying sentiment scores.

                  giving that most of us are already involved in revision for other units and
                  other work commitments it was very difficult to organise an 'online team' ,
                  it was another non-enjoyable part of the subject.

                      different lecturers, links to earlier topics were consistently identified and
                      helped to integrate the underlying biochemistry and physiology.  I
                      particularly liked the use of papers v text books and thought this reinforced
                      the learning goals of the two written assessments.
